## 18 July 2020 - First qualitative analysis embedded into dataset (English only)

Now the field <code>qualitative</code> might assume three value: 'relevant', 'linked', 'off-topic'; we pass trought all the videos suggested by YouTube on the right column, only concerning the BBC English video of our experiment. 

#### Qualitative analysis attribution criteria:
* **relevant**: the video talk actually about covid-19, coronavirus, lockdown, etc..
* **linked**: the video has another subject, but it is linked because talks about health, past pandemincs.
* **off-topic**: anything else.

You can get the files named 'qualitative' [from the dedicated repository](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/experiments-data/tree/master/wetest1), and this [public tableau simple visualization](https://public.tableau.com/profile/claudio.of.tracking.exposed#!/vizhome/weTest1-Qualitativefirstreview/Sheet1?publish=yes) might help third party revision. Below, a complete cell from file _qualitative-œâœÑ1-v7.json_.

## 2 July 2020 - Released dataset v7, and youtube official API historical data.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-4 ">
    <a href="https://github.com/tracking-exposed/experiments-data/tree/master/wetest1" target=_blank>

      <br>
      {{<colorblock color="secondary" text="Download dataset v.7">}}
    </a>
  </div>
  <div class="col-8 ">
    <ul>
      <li>Added <code>thumbnail</code> URL.</li>
      <li>Added <code>isAPItoo</code> (true|false) by comparing <b>if the recommended videoId</b> is also among the related videoId returned by the official youtube API. We retrieve the data on the 25th of March, the day of the experiment.</li>
      <li>Added <code>sessionId</code> to link and filter only complete session.</li>
      <li>Added <code>hoursOffset</code> a number of hours starting from 0 till 47, it represents time as offset. 0 is the beginning of the experiment (midnight, 25th of March). The software culculate from <code>savingTime</code>. Note, we didn't use <code>clientTime</code> because that's bound to the timezone, our server is in GMT-0.</li>
      <li>Added <code>top20</code>: a boolean field that tells if the evidence has a <code>recommendationOrder</code> lesser than 20. 20 it is the default amount of recommended display to every watcher, and *optionally*, if a watcher scroll down, youtube send more recommendations.</li>
      <li>Consider <code>recommendedId</code> and <code>id</code> are both equivalents as a unique identifiers.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

##### The new released data

* **Session file**: only 66 unique profile complete a session, we are not considering additional session per tester, at the moment. This amount is quite small considering the effort we put on this \[*swearing*\].
* **Youtube official API**: in the 25th of March we fetch the youtube API to see what the company was declared as 'related'. Our goal was to reproduce this (2019) venn diagram equivalence, 

##### On fact-checking + crowdsourcing

To judge youtube quality selection, we need people understanding Chinese, Arabic, and all the languages of the experiment and manually review the recommended videos. This crowdsourced qualitative assessment should give an indicator on how Youtube claims and methodology are accurate.

At the moment we can't organize such review, but if any partner display such interest youtube-team at tracking dot exposed.

By reading analysis such as [Saudi Arabia sstate media and covid-19](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/saudi-arabia-state-media-and-covid-19), or [Pandemics and chinese-attributed propagand](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/pandemics-propaganda-how-chinese-state-media-creates-and-propagates-ccp-coronavirus-narratives/), it is clear Youtube **can't** do qualitative analysis with their machines. Artificial Intelligence isn't suitable to addess this problem. Until we do not prove it, any company would keep claiming they address content curation with "better algorithm" altought should be clear this is not technically, and logically, possible.

## 17 June 2020 - Relased dataset v6

Uh? Three months of silence and <b>six</b> version jump? What does it mean? A difficult task and experiment were about transforming human-readable strings into ISOData format. Now we have got a unique shiny piece of technology to further integrate into the browser extension. It has been an intense stream of work in between other tasks, such as fundraising. Now there is a bunch of new shiny metadata, notably:

<b>The distance in seconds </b>between the user-watching-moment and the publication date of the related video. A researcher now might sort by newest-oldest recommendation. The <b>publication time</b> in ISODate format. <b>Number of views</b> of recommended video <b>in integer</b>. Likes and Dislikes of the watched video in integer, and please check the big link below to see more.

## 27 March 2020 - üéÜ Test completed! üéÜ

üéÜ **Thanks to everybody contributing and spreading the experiment** üéÜ

Since then, we have released the data, extended the dataset as much as we feel it helpful, and improved how it is openly accessed.
We‚Äôll keep updating this page.

### Anonymization and data release

The purpose of this dataset is a research on personalization algorithms. 
*The dataset has not and do not aim to have personal data.*
What follows is a brief description on how do we work to avoid to keep volunteer's personal data.

We should consider that among the ‚Äòrelated content,‚Äô YouTube may likely recommend something related to previous individual activities. 
Is it very possible that Youtube already creates a curated selection so personal, that may link to an individual uniquely. Could that de-anonymize a subject or an interest of a data subject? The answer is, ‚Äúmaybe if supported by an out-of-band leak.‚Äù

But, even in the worst-case scenario, we estimate this can‚Äôt lead to a leakage of personal data,

The purpose of this dataset is the research on personalization algorithm. The dataset has not personal data, despite the fact that the personalization of YouTube depends on personal data (thus, legally acknowledged as data subject). 

de-anonymization attacks such as relinking by searching for known patterns is not considered feasable because: Attacker should know how patterns appears on Youtube personalization algorithm and this is not known. Youtube himself, a property of Alphabet inc., is likely to be the only entity who might be interested in de-anonymize volunteers, but we estimated they might already have such knowledge if they really want to have it.

*We believe that People supporting the experiment would not be exposed to a risk for participating, as it is, at the moment, aimed to a still explorative scientific research.*

_note_ checkout [public stats](/impact) if curious un how we doing, or in the [github repository](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/yttrex).

## 26 March 2020 ‚Äî First day, a few statistics and a partial data release

At the end of day 1, we see a smaller contribution compared to [pornhub collaborative test](https://pornhub.tracking.exposed/potest/announcement-1/#update-n-2-20-january-2020). Considering our 13 days before the weTEST day, we had an average of 79.3 daily adopters. Yesterday 168 people active, 72 new installations, likely each of them start to do the test.

  <span class="col-xs-12 col-md-6"><img width="100%" src="/images/wt1/day1wetest1lastactive.png"></span>
</div>

#### Data analysis and Data format


Assume a person starts the test: open homepage, open five links, what if forget the 2nd links? 
Since 26th early morning, we di not had visual feedback to remind you which links you already clicked. And we notice, for example, the Chinese-language-Codiv video has five access more than the Arabic. Does it means someone start the test and abandoned? Or our system has a small percentage of failures? Or that video wasn't loaded from youtube? We don't know. But does this precision matter? should we clean the dataset of the incomplete session? A complete session being with accessing the homepage, in the right sequence, access the five videos, and it concludes with the homepage again.

We distinguish between **Session-centered dataset** it considers only **complete sessions** composed of seven observations each. **Page-centered dataset** do not consider the session. It keep in account video and homepage evidence, good as they are, indiviudual decontextualized observed evidence. **Basic researches on diversity and content analysis** can start with this. 

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-6 ">
    {{<colorblock text="Session-centered dataset">}}
    To extract the session we are working on a dedicated nodejs script <a href="https://github.com/tracking-exposed/yttrex/blob/master/backend/scripts/wetest1.js" target=_blank>wetest1.js</a>; we'll complete it in the next days.

  <p>Don't be surprised smarter experiments might be modeled. For example, prof. <a href="https://data-activism.net/author/davide/" target=_blank>
  Davide Beraldo
  </a> and Salvatore Romano coordinated a test with logged profiles and by simulating political leaning (on what? you tell me, check out: <a href="/trexit">Trexit</a>), they recorded how YT diversify the informative experiences.</p>

      <p>Testing a personalization algorithm isn't quick and straightforward, as it seems. The researcher has to define a methodology. This method gives different values to the collected samples because they are only useful to test the assumptions initially made.

        Because wetest wants to be a collaborative experiment, it is smart to develop initial findings without assuming any past research. We'll start with a few concise research questions. 
        <br>
        Inevitability, at the beginning, these question are more technical than focused on studying the political impact of the recommendation algorithms. In this initial phase we focus on developing tools and best practices. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Tracking.exposed goals aren't merely to produce reports, articles, or researches. Yes, we do it, (look at our <a href="/">home</a>, bottom-left); it has been part of our training experience. Algorithm accountability can't be revolutionary if accessible only to data analyst and data protection authority. A bit of knowledge on platform influence, or algorithm literacy, should be in the modern background education, and we want to play with it. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Do you remember, companies taking a bunch of random users and experiment on them? 
          <b>We'll do precisely the opposite</b>: 
          <b>a distributed crowd of random individuals, coordinated to experiment on them!</b>
          Anyone can contribute. Someone with a clean, freshly installed browser, someone else with their Google account logged. Partecipants, during the chosen day, should watch a few videos, and we'll collect the video the platform will recommend. We will run analysis to see how much diverse ends up to be suggested video. 
          <br<br>
          It is the most basic calculus on how much is unique, personalized, the experience the company decide for us.

          Farshad Shadloo, a YouTube spokesman, said the company‚Äôs recommendations aimed to steer people toward authoritative videos that leave them satisfied. He said the company was continually improving the algorithm that generates the recommendations. ‚ÄúOver the past year alone, we‚Äôve launched over 30 different changes to reduce recommendations of borderline content and harmful misinformation, including climate change misinformation and other types of conspiracy videos,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThanks to this change, watchtime this type of content gets from recommendations has dropped by over 70 percent in the U.S.‚Äù

      <p>
        In commentary such as the one above, there are two pitfalls: <b>a language issue</b>, and a <b>trust issue</b>.
        <br>
        Maybe YT is right, and in English language, for the US audience, Youtube investment might guarantee a quality in content curaction high enough to avoid fines, but would be that true in another language? 
        <br>
        The exploitative business model of surveillance capitalism can't easily scale when the succes metric is the _removal of content troublesome for a precise culture_ because investing in content moderator trained and balanced in every culture in the world seems unfeasable due to high costs.
        <br>
        This first experiment concentrate effort in watching four videos chosen by us, on the same broad topic (covid19), in the four most used langagues in the world.
        <br>
        Regardless of trust, how is credible a company who promise changes, (they are invisible), and the quality assessment of such improvements comes from the same organization? Independent testing, like the one we want to enable, is an option accessible to you, to a class of students, to the FTC and to the DPAs.

  <h3>
    We want to apply the most scientific, open, distributed approach we can aim for
  </h3>
  <p class="enlarged">
    <b>Diversity is the key</b>, but how exactly?
    <br>
    <br>
    Personalization algorithms, content curation, and targeted experiences are unique for each of us. 
    <br>
    Winning the fight for algorithmic independence (when you retain agency and control on the prioritization filter know as recommendation system), make sense if most of us reach that point. A minority of techno elite, literate enough to fact-check and with the skills to find the right information online, would only reinforce inequality among the people in the information age. Diversity is the key because we collectively should understand how other people are perceiving the public discourse. 
    <br>
    A widely deployed recommendation system should be validated by a public policy. It should be subject to public scrutiny, gauging the impact on all of us. Just in 2020, the goal is not a better society but a fluid business flow in the monopolist's hand.
    <br>
    Algorithm analysis might seems a purely technical effort. But the platform we're operating on (Facebook, youtube, amazon) mixes social constructs with their technology, and implicitly, the limited form of algorithm analysis we can perform via passive observation, inherit complexities typical of political analysis.
    <br>
    <br>
    Now, with wetest#1, <b>we begin with the technical analysis</b>, to build up a knowledge base robust enough to address <b>political and sociological analysis</b>. We can't yet address research questions such as "<i>Does youtube radicalize or not people?</i>" or "<i>are videos with blonde white women prioritized against other demographics? It is true in any region?</i>". We want to coordinate tests with these politically meaningful topics, but we can't yet, they aren't low hanging fruits. Releasing approximative analysis would be detrimental for algorithm literacy and platform accountability. Let's build this community with academics and digital rights defender.

    , and please consider:
    <ol class="enlarged">
      <li>we should start to measure technical conditions, and be confident in testing such variables.</li>
      <li>read other issues marked in the same way; this might help to understand which limits this test has.</li>
      <li>research questions should come from the community: concerned citizen, seasoned professional expert, to submit a proposal open a GitHub issue in our repository.</li>
