# Why ? 

We strongly expects **algorithmic content curation**, as form of power and control, would be used and **abused** in many ways by multiple actors.
**We concentrate** in developing technology to enable healthy discussion and skeptic analysis.
**We commit** in transferring the centralization power to the border of the network.
