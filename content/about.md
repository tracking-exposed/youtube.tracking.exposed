## Why ? To help digital activism and analysts in assessing algorithmic influences

**We strongly expects** algorithmic content curation, as form of power and control, would be used and abused in many ways by multiple actors.
**We acknowldge** our limits in even slightly shaping this political debate.
**We concentrate** in developing technology to enable healthy discussion and skeptic analysis.
**We commit** in transferring the centralization power to the border of the network.
