# Fundation of Algorithm Analysis

As reference you can read [Auditing Algorithms:  Research Methods for Detecting Discrimination on Internet Platforms](http://social.cs.uiuc.edu/papers/pdfs/ICA2014-Sandvig.pdf). Here in this document we talk about which kind of the theory thereby outlined can apply to YouTube.

In the paper they go by the name of _Scraping Audit_, _Sock Puppet Audit_, and _Crowdsourced Audit / Collaborative Audit_. In the practical sense any of it has some limit when apply to YouTube, and we suggest a research should imagine how to use the three of them to produce a robust criticism.
