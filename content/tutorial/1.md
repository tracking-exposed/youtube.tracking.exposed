# What is Tracking Exposed ?

Tracking Exposed is an opne and free software to idependetly analyze the effects of the algorithmic diffusion of contents online. 

- Main site is [Tracking.Exposed](https://tracking.exposed), with the [Manifesto](https://tracking.exposed/manifesto/) expressing our utopian goals.
- Read our past publication (peer review and not) [Analysis and Publications](https://facebook.tracking.exposed/analysis-and-publications/).
- Check the four platform supported so far [Facebook](https://facebook.tracking.exposed), [Youtube](https://youtube.tracking.exposed), [Pornhub](https://pornhub.tracking.exposed) and [Amazon](https://amazon.tracking.exposed), each oh them has a dedicated website, browser extension, and backnd code with all the HTML parser.
- Take a tour in the [Git repositories](https://github.com/tracking-exposed), and consider to contribute a everything is released in AGPL license.

# Youtube Tracking Exposed / Introduction

Dependingly on what you want to do as algorithm analyst, you might need a tool to collect evidence of personalization (and thus collect data for further analysis) or data collected by researchers with the use of this tool:

{{<yt-extension>}}

- You need to install it in order to collect evidence of personalization. If you are a data scientist that want to play with opendata, plase skip to [Tutorial N5, Analysis](/tutorial/5).
- Once you've installed it, remind to check, the indicator on the top right of youtube page, and your personal page, which has a dedicated [Tutoria N3](/tutorial/3).
- Why the extension? because you [can't rely on API, we demonstrate it in 2019], and we also skip also the other erroneus approach, like, _running test from a single point of observation_.
