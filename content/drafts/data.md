{{<colorblock text="Methodologies">}}

The collection methodology is a crucial attribute to judge, use and analyze evidences of algorithm personalization.

Compare blindly and acritically _how YouTube serves different related content_ it is good only for simple exercise, but this approach wouldn't produce any meaningful observation to figure out anything on YouTube.
On the table below, we summarize the different approaches and the _qualities of data collected_.

{{<colorblock text="Silicon Valley exploitative business model tought to people “more data, the better”. This page intent is also in stating why this blind and acritical data collection do not make any sense for us, for the researches, and for our message.">}}

## A researcher willing in understanding personalization and algorithmic discrimination, should give more importance to the methodology and [data collection](https://alshams.github.io/responsibledata/bias-in-data-viz/), be simple and explainable.

{{<colorblock text="Experiments and Experiences on algorithmic testing">}}

## — The first workshop — 3 working days — 10 students & 2 facilitators

{{< entry 
    text="10 different students using their computers, open the same video at the same time. Here we compare the 20 related videos suggested" 
    picture="/images/yt-results/clean-browsers-pattern.svg" 
    type="left" 
    legend-image-url="/images/yt-results/fixed-legend-6,7.svg"
>}}

— The blue circles represent the *related content*, they are all in the center because they are shared among profiles.

— The small groups of individually-selected-videos are represented with Green circles, and profile 4 and 3, have such dedicated content because of their configured computer language (Korean and French, while the test was performed from Amsterdam in English).

— Below, the same test did by the same students, same room and IP address, same computers, but with their browser logged in Google/YouTube:

{{< entry 
    text="It is visually clear how the data points linked to the profiles cause personalized suggestions." 
    picture="/images/yt-results/personalized-browsers-pattern.svg" 
    type="right"
    legend-image-url="/images/yt-results/fixed-legend-6,7.svg"
>}}

#### Regardless of Youtube API

We verified which videos YouTube declares as _related_ by using the official API, and then compared those with what is actually displayed on people interface.

{{< entry 
    text="Red circles represent the videos declared by YT as related. In yellow and green, the videos actually suggested to watchers." 
    picture="/images/yt-results/youtube-API-vs-TREX-observations.svg" 
    type="right"
    legend-image-url="/images/yt-results/fixed-legend-3.svg"
>}}

We knew API they can't be considered a reliable method, I want to list why this misunderstanding is 


— **Achievements**: have a rudimental method to compare among profile with reduced personalization vs profile highly personalizeed.

## — The second workshop

**Work in progress** TODO [trexit](/trexit)

## — Collaborative, Worldwide, time restricted, guided observation (potest and wetest)

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-6">
    <br>
    The collaborative observation is a new experiment in this regards. allow us to guide people in a few steps, we did it on <a href="https://pornhub.tracking.exposed/potest/final-1" target=_blank>PornHub, the name was poTEST</a>, the Youtube collaborative test is a March 2020 experiment.

## — Variable comparison 

TODO explain from [first test](/results) the CNN/FOX test.

{{< entry 
    title="A network visualization and analysis tool"
    text=""
    picture="/images/yt-results/after-two-minutes-profiling.svg"

## — Automatized access approach 

linkare methodology e mettere qui alcuni dei risultati (se unici e se possibili solo con accesso automatizzato) 

{{<colorblock text="Tools for analysts">}}

TODO, should be done a list of tools we used, which limits and perks:

* [en.wikipeda/Gephi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gephi), 
* [rawgraphs](https://rawgraphs.io), 
* Our dashboard (AudIt)
