{{<colorblock text="Intro">}}

# [Some people](/impact) install [our browser extension](/preview), and this scrape for them a few portions of their youtube pages for. We designed the technology to monitor and understand YouTube and NOT profile the volunteers participating in data donations.
---
We document [the data minimization](/privacy), the code is [free software](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/yttrex/), and we care to explain the ([open](/data) and [replicable](/wetest/1)) research methodology! We believe anyone might want to audit the Youtube algorithm. After all, if Google experiments with you, why you shouldn't experiment with them?

# Then with out analysis we extract informations on how YouTube personalize recommendations, homepages, and search results. A step in this process is to filter what content-related from what is profile-related.

_recommended for you_ was a small information that display, somehow, the interest of Google in being explicit on what was algorithmically selected for you compared to what is (algorithmically, again) selected because content related. Well: not anymore, it's gone!

<div id="october-2020-graph" class="c3graph"></div>

It might be handy to see the percentage (between all the recommended video collected and how many of them were explicitly _recommended for you_):
