<div id="processing-graph" class="c3graph"></div>

_Below a graph on how our parsers are performing: how many HTMLs have been parsed successfully or not. The failures count might not be a failure from the parsers, but rather the collection of pages not yet supported (such as homepage, search results, channel, and others)._

---
## video metadata (recommendations)
<div id="videos-related-graph" class="c3graph"></div>

_How is the video parser working? how it is our usage of the platform? Consider a new language might not be supported, and here we should spot it_

### Statistics and OpenData enable network effects, data reuse, and collaborative revision of our project. But they are tricky and can't be released carelessly:

* [Data can't be anonymized](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/23/anonymised-data-never-be-anonymous-enough-study-finds) easily, we aggregate them and we use only non-personal metadata to develop the aggregation.
* We don't want to help in any way [social media intelligence](https://responsibledata.io/social-media-intelligence-the-wayward-child-of-open-source-intelligence/).
* It is in our DNA [to enable researchers](/data-activism), we described our [data usage policies](/privacy).
* The public stats below display how the system is performing, how the people use it (no content-related analysis are here).
