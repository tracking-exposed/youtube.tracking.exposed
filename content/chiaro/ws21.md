You should have the extension installed, and by clicking on the popup, consent to data processing. If not:

{{<yt-extension>}}

### You might eventually use an automation to train your browser/profile, if isn't your personal one.

1. Read Chrome --user-data-dir documentation, that's explain how the browser might be manager to ensure only new cookies/localstorage/extensions would be used in the session
2. Download [yttrex repository](github.com/tracking-exposed/yttrex/), follow the instruction in [automation](/automation), and consider the training files for [progressive](/json/progressive-filtertube.json) and [conservative](/json/conservative-filtertube.json) personas.

### Now please click on 'repeat' and the extension would record your results.
